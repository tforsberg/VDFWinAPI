Windows API Library for Visual DataFlex
=======================================

Every DLL in used in the Windows API will have a separate class.

Many individual calls will have a child class of the the DLL class in which they belong.

For Example:

Kernel32.dll
	GlobalMemoryStatus
	GlobalMemoryStatusEx


=======================================

To: Any and all other developers

	This is an open source project, and as such, I am
	Open to any and all ideas as to the direction of this
	project.  Initially, I will try to guide and steer the project
	as I see it, but I will always take community direction over mine.
